# AAII Technical Lecture Series (ATLS-16)
**Title:** How to Design a Brand, Start a Global Company and Decide When to go for Investments.



### Abstract: 
The talk explores global entrepreneurship through the lens of the eco-brand, Dzukou that was started during the pandemic. The speaker discusses how the co-founders designed their brand after conducting market ethnographic studies and user studies to find the market gap where they wanted to fit in. How they planned their products and strategized their product mix to bootstrap efficiently. That is exactly when the global Covid-19 pandemic hit. The founders then operated from different countries and hedged their risks by opening up operations globally. The speaker discusses how to go global without investing in millions. How much of functions to retain in-house and how much to outsource as a young company. And finally, the speaker discusses when is the exact point when any startup should start looking for investments, what are the possible avenues and how to start preparing for external financing.
