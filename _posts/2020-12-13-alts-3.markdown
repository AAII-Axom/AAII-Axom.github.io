# AAII Technical Lecture Series (ATLS-3)

>The use of machine learning (ML) technology has already been increasing over the past few years. This technological advancement increases the number of jobs in >diverse industrial sectors, where ML is the primary componentâ€”thereby growing the demand for engineers/scientists/researchers with expertise in ML.

In this version of ATLS, our invited speaker gave a brief overview of different aspects of ML interview and how one should structure his/her interview preparation process.

### The outline of the talk was -
* General Preparations
* Interview process
* Machine Learning
* Research
* Coding
    * [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
    * [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
* Case Studies
Dr. Banriskhem emphasized the importance of studying/analyzing ML case studies while preparing for the interviews. He also explained how one should formulate an ML case study problem and execute it in a structured manner by discussing a few case studies' examples.
    * How logistic regression model can be estimated by the probabilistic framework called maximum likelihood estimation
    * Decision tree
    * Scrambled sentences having the same kind of permutation
    * Language modeling
