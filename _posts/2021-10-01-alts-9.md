# AAII Technical Lecture Series (ATLS-9)

>Have you ever wondered how the human brain works? How are researchers developing computational models to decode brain circuitry? How does ML/DL/VR playing a major role in interpreting the brain? What is computational neuroscience? To answer all these questions, in this version of the *AAII Technical Lecture Series*, we invited *Biswadeep Khan, Ph.D. Researcher at The Hong Kong University of Science* as our esteemed speaker.

Abstract:
>This talk covers the basics and some interesting areas of active research in neuroscience. Biswadeep also discussed in detail the use of computational methods and mathematics domain knowledge for the application of machine learning techniques and virtual reality in neuroscience research.
