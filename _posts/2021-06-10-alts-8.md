# AAII Technical Lecture Series (ATLS-8)

**Title:** Introduction to Hardware and Software Infrastructure for Large Scale Computing with an excursion to Google's Carbon Intelligent Computing Platform

#### Abstract
Have you ever wondered how google data centres work? What are the physical infrastructures required to enable day-to-day Google services we use? How are Google engineers trying to minimize Carbon emission in their data centers? To answer all these questions, in the this version of the AAII Technical Lecture Series (ATLS â€“ 8), we invited Dr. Saurav Talukdar from Google, USA.

In this talk, first, the physical infrastructure required to enable the day-to-day Google services we use are discussed. This  involves a description of the servers, power, and cooling aspects of Google data centers. Then, Saurav briefly mentioned about thee software stack, which manages the computing resources across the globe. Finally, gave some idea how to operate the data centers in a manner that is aware of the carbon footprint of computing.
