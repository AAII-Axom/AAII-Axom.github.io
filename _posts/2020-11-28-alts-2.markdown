# AAII Technical Lecture Series (ATLS-2)

>Yann LeCun described Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) as "the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in Machine Learning". GAN is a class of deep >generative networks, developed by Ian Goodfellow and other researchers at the University of Montreal, including Yoshua Bengio, in 2014. Generative means, in simple >words, is that it can generate new content, e.g., it can create new artwork or a new piece of music that never exists.

To explore this exciting topic, AAII invited Dr. Nagaraj Adiga, a senior research scientist from Zapr Media Labs, who has vast experiences of using GAN in different speech applications. 

### The outline of the talk was -
* Basics of GAN
* Different types of GANs and their applications
* Applications of GAN
* Demo - How to train a GAN model

About speaker:
Dr. Nagaraj Adiga is currently working on the GANs and autoregressive architectures for different speech applications like Enhancement, Recognition, Synthesis, and Voice Conversion. Before joining Zapr Media Labs as a research scientist, he worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Crete, Greece, and a Signal Processing Engineer in Apple Inc. in developing neural-based text to speech (TTS) systems in noisy scenarios.
