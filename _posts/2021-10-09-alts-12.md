#### Abstract
In this talk, Nabarun will mainly cover his journey from being an Engineer to a Researcher. He will talk about how he went from working as a Software Engineer at Sony to being a Researcher at Sony and finally the transition back to academia first as a Master's student and now as a Doctoral student at the University of Tokyo. His primary research interest is in the confluence of Audio, Language, and Artificial Intelligence. He will be talking about Audio Source Separation and introduce his current research area, i.e. Speech Synthesis.  He will talk about source separation in terms of music (extracting the different instruments and tracks from a song) as well as separating individual speech segments from mixed speech with multiple speakers.  As for speech synthesis, He will give a brief overview of the task and some of the current methods for synthesizing natural speech.
